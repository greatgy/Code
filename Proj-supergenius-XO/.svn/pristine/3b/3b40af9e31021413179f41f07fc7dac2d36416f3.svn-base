California Residents: Responding to Do Not Track Signals</div>\n                    <p>In September 2013, California enacted amendments to the California Online Privacy Protection Act (California Business & Professions Code §§22575-22579) which require operators of websites to disclose how they respond to \"do not track\" (DNT) signals from browsers used by consumers or other mechanisms that provide consumers a choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about the consumer\'s online activities over time and across different websites or online services. While some newer browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" features which, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked, a DNT protocol that can be implemented across multiple devices and sites has not yet been widely adopted. Currently, our computer system does not support, and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive; accordingly, the choices that we provide you concerning out collection and use of personally identifiable information will continue to operate as described in this policy.</p>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"prevacydtail\" id=\"policyol14\">\n                    <div class=\"dtailtitle\">14.
